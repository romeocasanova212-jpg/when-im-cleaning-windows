# Project Recovery Instructions

The Firebase SDK that was partially imported had corrupted files. I've removed it.

## To Fix the Project:

### Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)
1. Close Unity Editor
2. Delete the `Library/` folder (entire directory)
3. Reopen the project in Unity - let it reimport everything (~2 minutes)
4. Done! All errors should be gone

### Option 2: Manual in Editor
1. Just wait ~30 seconds for Unity to recompile
2. Errors should disappear automatically

### Verification
After recompiling, you should see:
- ✅ 0 Compilation Errors
- ✅ Project loads normally
- ✅ Can run setup menu again

## What Was Done
- ✅ Removed corrupted Firebase SDK folder
- ✅ Removed Firebase.meta file
- ✅ All project code remains intact
- ✅ Conditional compilation still active

## Next Steps After Fix
1. Verify project compiles with 0 errors
2. Run one-click setup menu again
3. Test the game
4. For Firebase integration, follow [FIREBASE_INSTALLATION.md](../Docs/FIREBASE_INSTALLATION.md)

The project will now work perfectly without Firebase (as intended), and Firebase can be installed cleanly later when ready.
